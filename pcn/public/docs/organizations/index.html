                description: "Why did I make this?",
                content: "Phew, making a whole repository is a lot of work. So many pages and so many broken things everywhere. I appreciate all the comments and attempts at critique so far. It has been super fun building this whole thing out, working on the map, and learning all sorts of new things.\nThe Changes linkAre there really any changes that can be said when you are creating something entirely new? No, there are not. But! That won’t stop me from telling you all the crud I’ve been getting up to since this project began.\nBuilt a repository to store all this junk in. Started desiging the repo. Got distracted with NS stats, again Built the tabula rasa map Reconnected with the region. Doesn’t seem like much when I shorten it up like that but that’s what I’ve been up to. There is still much more to do. This weekend and the following week I am, as many of you might be, busy with festivities. I’m not gonna grind this project 24/7 but I will keep it updated. I have the repo stored here on Github and on three of my machines as well as my phone. So, whenever something comes to mind that I need to change or fix quick, I can.\nThe Philosophy linkIf you recall this post\nDid you really reread that entire thing? Well, if ya did, you know the full extent of my original ambitions with this project. And if you’ve been keeping an eye on the RMB recently, you’ll know I’ve already made comments on this subject. Regardless, this project has been a blast so far. And I know you might be wondering, “Gee Nedea, when did you get all this energy to actually touch your damn map?”\nDistractions, and enthusiasm. That’s what kept getting in my way. When you become a cartographer, there is so much you want to do to make your map beautiful and user friendly. Despite my efforts, I kept getting lost in the sauce. “OOOOH what is this shiny thing?” “I wonder if I could make it do that?” Or my personal favorite, “Oh snap, I was supposed to be working on that map wasn’t I?”\nEnthusiasm makes or breaks any project, and as I mentioned before, there are a multitude of reasons why my enthusiam waxes or wanes. Whether it’s just my personal life getting in the way, the RMB quieting, participation in certain RP events, a new project, or just sheer laziness, it happens. And the biggest reason it wanes, is because of my documentation.\nNow there is a keyword, documentation. It’s important. Remember taking notes in school? Remember documenting what the instructor was teaching you? Yea, I do. The biggest hurdle to progress was my own crappy documentation. Truthfully, I could not even tell you how to update the 2.0 map if you asked me to. It got out of control and then one sabbatical later, I have no idea what I am even looking at. So what is the reason for all this ambition flowing through me?\nThis repository. Gone are the days where I discuss something interesting and it’s gone to the wind. No longer will we invent something only for it to be lost a few weeks later. Now that everything can be documented, saved, explored, invented, discussed, and reviewed within this repository, we can actually keep track of the entire project. If I need to take a week off, I won’t be lost when I come back. That’s why. Because no matter how far I get, I know the project will be safe, and understandable to future me. It won’t become the quagmire of insanity it always drifts towards.\nAnd hey, BTW, I love getting lost in the sauce. I love exploring all sorts of neato things to add or investigate further. But Ath was right, I need to dial things back sometimes and just get a minimal viable product out. When I refounded this great region, I did so not to just preserve our decade plus heritage, I did so to reignite that flame we had long ago. It is to no one’s surprise NCON has been in a timeless sunset for like, what? 5 or 6 years? Wow, that is a long time. That means for at least a third of my NS career, I’ve just been a bump on a log.\nI know most of us are in a sort of “NS retirement”. We did the thing, we tried to do more things, we had a good time, and we chat a little. Meanwhile we slowly dwindle down to nothing. Leaving behind only a wimper as the last of us quietly disengage and move on. And that’s fine. Really, if you want to retire, I have no problem with that.\nI love you guys, or at least what’s left of you guys. And we may never see a return to the glory days of past, but that doesn’t mean I won’t try. There are thousands of nations looking for a home like ours. All we have to do is pick up the pieces and restore our monument. My ultimate goal is to rebuild what we have to at least a fraction of what we had. Then, when the time comes, we pass the torch. We hand off the mantle of NCON to our successors. I hand off this repository to a trusted newby, and we all go get drinks. Knowing our legacy is preserved forever within this repo.\nIn closing, I just want to say, I don’t expect anything from any of you. I know some of you have a little spark left in you for some creativity, and all I ask is you put it to use somewhere. I’ll keep plugging away at this project. Dutifully updating the map, carefully cataloging our Roleplays, curiously investigating new activities, and intentionally archiving our history with one another.\nOur motto is “Yield not to misfortune!” for a reason.\nWe won’t.\nNe Cede Malis!\n"

                title: "Some Musings on Production",
                description: "Make economics make cents!",
                content: "There has been some talk about stats again. You can never really get away from it can you? I have been dwelling on this subject for a minute now and I think I have a fairly solid idea for how to handle production, income, trade, and all the bells and whistles that comes with. Firstly, I want to cover Production Classes.\nAlso, I AM trying to make a map here guys, I know the stat stuff is interesting, but map comes first! All of this is on the Wish List after all.\nProduction Classes linkEach industry has three classes of goods it produces, Bulk, Consumer, \u0026 Luxury. Each class automatically occupies a certain % of that specific industries productive power (I’ll get around to codifying terms and definitions at a later date). To begin, when a nation registers with the Economic System, all their stats will be crunched and they will get an overview of how productive each class is in each industry. These classes are just defaults and represent the totality of products within that industry.\nBulk goods require 30% of Production Consumer goods require 60% of Production Luxury goods require 10% of Production. Athretvari made a good point earlier about a desire to commit certain %’s to custom products that can flow through the system. Initially, I thought this would require insane overhead on my part. But after a serious brain blast, I realized I can just ’tag’ these custom products with a Production Class. What does this look like? Well firstly, let’s define all the possible tags…\nArms Manufacturing linkARMABUL ARMACON ARMALUX\nAutomobile Manufacturing linkAUTOMABUL AUTOMACON AUTOMALUX\nBasket Weaving linkBASWEBUL BASWECON BASWELUX\nBeverage Sales linkBEVESABUL BEVESACON BEVESALUX\nBook Publishing linkBOOPUBUL BOOPUCON BOOPULUX\nCheese Exports linkCHEEXPBUL CHEEXPCON CHEEXLUX\nFurniture Restoration linkFURRESBUL FURRECON FURRELUX\nGambling linkGAMBUL GAMCON GAMLUX\nInformation Technology linkINFOTBUL INFOTCON INFOTLUX\nInsurance linkINSUBUL INSUCON INSULUX\nMining linkMINBUL MINCON MINLUX\nPizza Delivery linkPIZZBUL PIZZCON PIZZLUX\nRetail linkRETAILBUL RETAILCON RETAILLUX\nTimber Wood Chipping linkTIMBERBUL TIMBERCON TIMBERLUX\nTrout Fishing linkTROFIBUL TROFICON TROFILUX\nNot so bad right? That’s only 75 distinct tags. At the beginning, that’s all your nation will produce, a certain amount of those products. Let’s use Trout Fishing as an example. At this time, we will also introduce our test nation, Drekar.\nDrekar has a TROFI (Trout Fishing Industry) of ⍋1,000. Using our predefined %’s, this would mean Drekar produces ⍋300 of TROFIBUL, ⍋600 of TROFICON, and ⍋100 of TROFILUX. These default products will enter the system, be consumed, exported, or stockpiled (Thanks Athretvari)\nNow, Drekar is a special guy, and he wants to add abit more color to his production. He decides he wants to register a specific product into the system. Let’s go with High Viscosity Whale Oil. He first determines what class this product is. Let’s go with Bulk. He then assigns a % of his Bulk Production to HVWO. He chooses 50%. He then let’s me know these details and I make the necessary adjustments to his Production Rules (I’ll touch on these a little later).\nHis TROFI now looks like:\n⍋150 HVWO ⍋150 TROFIBUL ⍋600 TROFICON ⍋100 TROFILUX\nHVWO is still considered a bulk product from the point of view in the system and confers no further benefit other than flavor. It will be measured and consumed the same way as any other product by industry/consumers/exports/etc that requires TROFIBUL. On your Balance Sheet, they will however, show as a seperate entry. Now, when he makes his trades, he can advertise that he has High Viscosity Whale Oil up for sale and he can make his own export agreements with that.\nIt should also be noted that when registering a product, you will have the option to make it Proprietary or Global. Proprietary Products are specific to your nation and cannot be registered by any other, and I’ll try to keep an eye out for copy cats. Global Products can be registered by any other nation if they wish. This helps us build a roster of available products that can be traded around without a bunch of similar products being registered, ie, Self-Sealing Stembolts VS Auto-Combining Stembolts.\nNow, before it is even asked, at this time I would prefer to not adjust your default %’s for your three classes. 30, 60, 10 seems like a good spread and I don’t see any reason to adjust this. Maybe if I find an NS stat or two that could feasibly affect these numbers, we can explore that. But in the meantime, let’s just stick to this ratio.\nThe Production Chain linkNow that we understand just what our industries are producing, let’s take a peek at how they are consumed and moved around.\nYour nation has 6 possible Demand Centers, each with different priorities. They are:\nIndustry | Priority 1 Hey, your industries gotta eat too! Expect a lot of pressure on Primary Indsutries; Mining, Trout Fishing, Insurance. Your Indsutry has no account balance, and receives all good for free*. Government | Priority 1 For some of you, this might be one of your biggest Demand Centers. Depending on your government expendeture, your government will buy all sorts of different products from your Industry. Your national budget will be used to pay for these goods. Consumers | Priority 1 Depending on various stats, your Consumers will apply different Demand Pressures on different products. Using various demographic information, income stats, etc, we will pay your industries with your disposable income. For those of you who tax every last penny from your citizens, that will be covered in a seperate changeblog. Business Subsidization | Priority 1 This is the ‘Industry’ part of your pie chart. Using that money, your government will purchase additional goods from your Industry and add it to the National Stockpile. Stockpiling | Priority 2 If for whatever reason you want to stockpile additional goods, that is chosen here. All P1 Demand Centers cannot be manually adjusted. You adjust those with the issues you answer. You will have more granular control over Stockpiling. Either by selecting a % of the surplus, or a raw ⍋ amount. Exports | Priority 3 Finally, if there is anything left over, this surplus will exported to the world at large. The system will first check if you have a trade agreement for any specific class of product, or custom product, and sell it to your counter party. Any remaining goods will be sold to the Commodities Broker at a price below cost. But what about deficits? linkDeficits can happen in two areas. You may encounter either monetary deficits or industrial deficits.\nIndustrial Deficits linkIndustrial Deficits happen when your local industry is unable to fulfill all P1 Demand Centers. When this occurs, you will be forced to import the shortfall from the global economy. The system will first check for any trade agreements you have for the product in question and if so, you will buy the goods from your counter party. Any goods that do not have a trade agreement in place will be purchased from the Commodities Broker at a price above cost. You may also allow your deficits to draw from any stockpiled goods you have before buying the goods abroad.\nMonetary Deficits linkMonetary Deficits happen when your government cannot afford to pay for any of its obligations or imports. When this happens, you will still receive the goods and ultimately fund your government, but you will be in the hole. If this goes on, it will have compounding effects on your economy. We cover the effects and solutions of to this later on.\nAccounting linkAccounting is near and dear to my heart. It’s like witchcraft with numbers. We invented it to make our lives easier. Did it actually though? Well, that’s not what we are exploring here.\nAnyway…\nAs a nation, you will have two accounts. Your Sovereign Account, and your Trade Account. After some amount of numerical sorcery, you will receive deposits into your Sovereign account. This money is yours to do with however you see fit. Lend it, spend it, save it. You will receive money into this account no matter how poorly your nation is running.\nYour Trade Account is a little different. When the dust settles after your trades are calculated, and net income will be deposited and net expenses will be withdrawn. If there is a positive balance remaining, you may tax it at whatever % rate you prefer. These taxes will be deposited into your Sovereign Account.\nBut I still have questions about deficits! linkOkay okay! Fine, lets cover that. Let’s first cover solutions to deficits before we go over all the bad things that can happen. Note, bad things happen based on your choices (Safe, Risky, Dangerous). :P\nIf you run a deficit in your Government Expenses, you can:\nUse money from your Sovereign Account to cover. Safe Take a loan from a friend. Safe - Dangerous Take a loan from the Commodities Broker. Risky - Dangerous Mint new currency. Safe - Dangerous Default. Dangerous Use the Sovereign Account linkMaybe you don’t run the best budget in the world, but you are an active trader on the Stock Market or Commodity Market. If you have enough funds here to cover your deficit, you suffer no drawbacks.\nTake a loan from a friend linkOkay, so maybe you’re not a great trader either, but at least you have a friend who can lend you some money. Depending on the interest they charge, and their proclivities, this can be anywhere from safe to dangerous.\nTake a loan from the Commodities Broker linkHuh, so you can’t trade, and you have no friends, or maybe they are also broke. Okay, well the Commodities Broker is here to rescue you! Sure, he charges a much higher interest rate than a friend would, but you’ll be able to pay it back right?\nMint new currency linkThis is where all you Keynesians can have your time in the sun. You can authorize any amount of currency to be minted and then deposited into your Sovereign Account, which from there you can cover your balance. Please note however, this will have downstream effects. Like making all the goods from your industry more expensive, inflation right? So this is pretty much kicking the can down the road, but on the bright side, Inflation will burn off by a certain % every cycle, so long as you don’t keep doing this.\nDefault linkThere is absolutely no reason why you should ever choose this option. But if you do, you will recieve an interest free bailout from the Commodities Broker (Or a friend is they have the dough to cover it). If this happens, well, I have no idea what happens. I suppose choosing this will require a bit of negotiation and Role-Playing but first thing that comes to mind is commiting a % of your national production to your creditors for a period of time.\nIt should also be noted that if your deficit reaches a certain % of GDP, you will automatically default. You really should have fixed this sooner. Though I will make provisions for nations taking a vacation so you don’t come back to a totally collapsed nation.\nConclusion linkSo there is a ton of information on what’s kicking around my noggin for the economic system. I can see a lot of interesting RP opportunities arising from this. Members of the IMF debating on what the Commodities Broker’s Interest Rate should be. Price fixing, currency wars, tarrifs, embargos. There is a lot we can explore here and I can’t wait to hear your opinions on all these.\n"

Detecting Enkon Delta’s habitability, the crew discovered a derelict station in orbit. After docking and repairing its missing control center—recovered from the planet’s surface—the station activated, revealing itself as NEXUS, a Doec AI. NEXUS shared knowledge of the gate network but prolonged exposure to Doecium (the material with which most of the station is constructed of) rendered the crew infertile. Unable to return home, they activated a beacon via NEXUS to summon humanity, then sealed the station.\nPre-Imperial Era link -500,000 AI: The Doec establish gates across the Abraxi Cluster, including the Enkon system.
