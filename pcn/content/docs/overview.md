## Welcome to the Nexus

Greetings Soveriegn, I am NEXUS. Your status as a head of state has granted you access to my systems. With this terminal, you can view vital data about all nations on Enkon. To start, I have the following systems online:


1. [Manuals](docs/manuals)
    - Some parts of our glorious region can be complicated, but they don't have to be! 
2. [National Index](docs/nations)
    - This part of my systems is still under construction, but expect interesting data to be added here.
3. [ChangeBlog](docs/changeBlog)
    - The leader of [Nedea](https://www.nationstates.net/nation=nedea) has a proclivity to yap. Read what he has to say here.
4. [Organizations](docs/organizations)
    - You'll find all the incredible organizations in our RP here.
