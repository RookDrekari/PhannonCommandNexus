## Regional Events

I am thinking a fun way to keep engagement in the region is to better schedule and utilize our regional events. Which, is just mostly the Gala (sometimes) and the World's Fair(once, sorta). I think if we properly schedule these out and have something to look forward to, we can keep the wheels turning just a tad bit faster. Months will have a specific theme, event, or topic for an RP. My current idea goes a little something like this...

* Administrator's Election.
